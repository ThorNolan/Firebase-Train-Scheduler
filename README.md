Firebase Train Scheduler
=====================================================
A simple train schedule application I made that utilizes Firebase to store user input data. The app features real-time updates for departure and arrival times.

## Technologies Used
+ Page elements and styling were done with HTML and CSS, and the game logic with Javascript. 
  
+ I used the jQuery library to dynamically update elements on my page. 
  
+ The application uses Firebase to host the data retrieved from the user-input form. 

+ Values from the form and database are manipulated with the Moment.js library.
