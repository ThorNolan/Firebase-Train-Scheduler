Firebase Train Scheduler
=====================================================
A simple train schedule application I made that utilizes Firebase to host user input data. The app features real-time updates for departure and arrival times.

## Technologies Used
+ Page elements and styling were done with HTML and CSS, and the logic with Javascript. 
  
+ I used the jQuery library to dynamically update elements on my page. 
  
+ The application uses Firebase to host the data retrieved from the user-input form. 

+ Values from the form and database are manipulated with the Moment.js library so that they can be displayed in a more user-friendly way.   

## How to Use the Site
Enter in information into the form displayed on the bottom of the page, and the page will communicate with a database hosted on Firebase that will store this information and update departure and arrival times. These times will be updated based on the current time at your location! 

## Sources For Icons/Art
